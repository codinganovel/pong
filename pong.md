Pong : 

# Pong Mission Statement

**Leave a note. Check your notes. That’s it.**

-----

Pong is the digital equivalent of leaving a sticky note on someone’s desk. Simple, ephemeral, and pressure-free.

## What Pong Is

**A shoulder tap, not a conversation starter.** Quick thoughts, casual thanks, gentle reminders. The kind of human connection that happens naturally in shared spaces, but reimagined for the distributed world of open source.

**Intentionally constrained.** One message per person. 140 characters. Auto-delete after being fetched or not fetched for 30 days. No replies, no threads, no history. These aren’t limitations—they’re features that keep communication light and purposeful.

**Built for developers, by developers.** CLI-first design that fits naturally into your existing workflow. GitHub OAuth integration means no new accounts, no new usernames—just reach out to people you already know from their code.

## What Pong Isn’t

Not another chat app. Not another notification source. Not a place for urgent conversations or complex discussions.

## The Philosophy

**Less is more.** Every feature we don’t build is a problem we don’t create. No spam (impossible with one-message limit). No notification fatigue (you check when you want). No social anxiety (no read receipts, no reply pressure).

**Respect attention as a finite resource.** Your pong sits quietly until someone chooses to look. Like a sticky note waiting on a desk, not a knock on the door demanding immediate response.

**Human connection shouldn’t be complicated.** Sometimes you just want to say “nice work on that commit” or “coffee later?” without starting a whole conversation thread.
